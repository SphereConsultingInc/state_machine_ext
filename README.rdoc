=== Class definition

  class Order

      event :choose do
        transition :not_selected => :selected
      end
      event :add_to_basket do

        transition :paid => :sent
      end

      #initialize groups of the states
      group :not_paid do
        state :not_selected
        state :selected
        state :in_basket
      end
      group :in_progress do
        state :paid, :sent
      end
    end
  end

=== Using extensions

  order = Order.new
  # returns the array of all the states which we can reach from the current one
  order.state_all_transitions                #=> [:sent, :paid, :in_basket, :selected]
  # same for the particular state
  order.state_all_transitions(:in_basket)    #=> [:sent, :paid]
  # check whether a group includes some state
  order.group(:not_paid).include?(:selected) #=> true
  # find groups to which belongs a state
  order.find_group(:paid)                    #=> [:in_progress]
